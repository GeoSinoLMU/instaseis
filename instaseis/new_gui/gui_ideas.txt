 - generalize datamodel: pipeline of model, source, receiver and filters
 - allow multiple of these pipelines

 - fix finite sources
 - 1D model from netcdf file (compare kerner)
 - add noise (HNM, LNM, external?)
 - magnitude slider
 - impacts
 - spectrogram, cwt
 - recordsection
 - global stack
 - finite source vizualization
 - travel times from a editable phase list
 - ray paths plot
 - particle motion
 - misfits between multiple pipelines (TFM)
 - save button for plots
 - 'generate code' button
 - show DB info only on load
 - overlay real data?
 - generic finite sources (line source?)

 - generate info pdf for a DB including plots of the model, recordsec etc in a nicely
   readable format
